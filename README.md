### Adding an index for local development

1. Ensure you have the `aws` cli installed. run `brew install awscli` if you don't.
2. Download the `v4_pileval_llama` index by running `aws s3 cp --no-sign-request --recursive s3://infini-gram-lite/index/v4_pileval_llama <this repo's folder location>/infinigram-array`

The `infinigram-array` folder is mounted to the Docker container for the API through the `docker-compose`.
